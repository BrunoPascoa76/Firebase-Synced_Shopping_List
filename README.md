# Firebase-Synced Shopping List

## Introduction

This project is a simple shopping list (w/categories) that uses Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Cloud Messaging to allow multiple people people to share the same always-synced shopping list.

## Features (WIP)

* Each user can have multiple shopping lists
* Shopping lists are organized into List->Category->Item
* Each item has a quantity and whether it's already been purchased
* QR-code base sharing (TODO)
* Realtime syncing when the list is opened (TODO)
* Background sync every 5mins via FCM (the sync will only be trigger if a change was detected) (TODO)
* English and Portuguese translations available (except for user-generated text)

## Usage

You are free to use this for yourselves. However, be aware that this is just a project for my parents I am doing because I was bored, so don't expect a lot of feedback or updates.
