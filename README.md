This project is a simple Compose app that uses Firebase (Realtime DB and FCM) to maintain shopping lists that can be shared and automatically detect new changes (so you don't have to worry about checking the app before going shopping).

This is more of a personal use project made for me and my family, but feel free to use it if you like it.
